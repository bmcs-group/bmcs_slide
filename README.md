# Interactive notebook for coupled sliding-decohesion-compression model

Annotated implementation of the coupled sliding-decohesion-compression model
(CSDCM) as a fundamental model component in monotonic and fatigue simulations
of material and structural behavior.

The jupyter notebook can be started on the binder service to show the 
derivation process using `sympy` and to run elementary examples
demonstrating the model features and reproducing selected examples
from the paper.
